# iso-preflight.sh: the gate an ISO build must clear BEFORE mkarchiso starts.
#
# An ISO build costs an hour or two and then ships to users, so the failure
# classes we have actually shipped are checked here first, in seconds:
#
#   offline resolution   an in-chroot pacman that cannot resolve from the baked
#                        repo (a registered repo with no synced db fails the whole
#                        transaction), so the desktop, drivers, or AUR set never
#                        install on a no-network box.
#   pacman hooks         a mask that collides with a packaged hook, or a hook left
#                        live through pacstrap (snapper with no config,
#                        limine-install against a /boot that is not an ESP).
#   package coverage     a package the installer can ask for that the offline bake
#                        does not carry.
#   boot menu            limine.conf shape, the alongside two-stage chain, the
#                        chainload entry for the existing OS.
#   installer contract   the dry-run step/sentinel matrix, the preflight refusals,
#                        the TUI's layout and safety gates.
#
# Everything here is hermetic and root-free: no disk, no network, no VM. The
# root-only partitioner and the QEMU boot chain stay in the Install backend tests
# workflow. Run it by hand before dispatching a build:
