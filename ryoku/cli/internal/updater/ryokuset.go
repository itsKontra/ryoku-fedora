// The Ryoku lane.
//
// `ryoku update` moves the packages Ryoku publishes, and nothing else. The base
// system and its kernel belong to the distribution the box was installed from
// (Arch or CachyOS), and the user takes those with `sudo pacman -Syu`, on their
// own schedule. Two lanes, for reasons that are the whole design:
//
//   - The kernel is not ours to move. Ryoku ships two variants and neither
//     kernel is published by us; a Ryoku release must never decide when a box
//     changes kernel, rebuilds its DKMS modules, or rewrites its boot image.
//   - A release must be reversible. `ryoku rollback` puts the Ryoku set back;
//     it cannot put Arch back, so an update that moved both was never fully
//     reversible in the first place.
//   - The lanes fail independently. A box that cannot take an Arch upgrade
//     today (a mirror out of sync, a held package, a full ESP) must still be
//     able to take a Ryoku fix, and the other way round.
//
// So this file is the only place that decides what `ryoku update` may touch:
// the installed packages the [ryoku] repository serves. Everything else is
// reported, never moved. `ryoku update --system` opts back into one command
// that also runs the user's lane, for people who want it.

// ryokuRepo is the repository name in /etc/pacman.conf. Targets are qualified
// with it ("ryoku/<name>"), so pacman resolves them from our repo even for a
// name that also exists in core/extra, whatever the section order is.
const ryokuRepo = "ryoku"

// externalReleasePkgs are packages the [ryoku] repo builds for a first install
// but that update on their OWN published-release channel afterwards, not through
// the Ryoku package lane. Ryotunes ships prebuilt Arch packages on its GitHub
// releases; `ryoku update` installs those directly (internal/ryotunesrelease,
// upgrade-only, sha256/arch/version-verified). Moving it from the [ryoku] repo
// set would DOWNGRADE a newer external build onto the repo's base version (an
// explicit `-S` moves a package down as well as up), so it is dropped from the
// update set and from the distribution lane's pending list, and tracked through
// its own channel instead. The initial install still comes from the repo (ISO
// pacstrap, ryoku-desktop optdepend) -- only the update path skips it.

// pacman): the caller must stop rather than fall back to a system upgrade,
// which is the other lane.
//
// allowDowngrade is false for an ordinary `ryoku update`: a package the box
// already carries at a NEWER version than [ryoku] serves is held back and
// counted in skipped. Two shapes make that real: a distro repo (CachyOS,
// extra) ahead of our vendored copy -- re-issuing ryoku/<name> there
// flip-flops the package up and back down inside one run and writes a .pacnew
// every time -- and a split official package (asusctl and rog-control-center)
// whose pinned dep an explicit downgrade would break, failing the whole
// transaction. A channel move and a rollback onto a frozen release pass true:
// there, moving the set DOWN is the point, and the frozen release is the only
// thing the box should keep.
//
// On Fedora nothing is held back: the set moves by `dnf distro-sync
// --repo=RyokuCOPR`, which settles every name on our build in one transaction,
// so no distro repo can flip-flop it and there is no .pacnew to churn.
