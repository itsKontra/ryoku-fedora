# Maintainer: Ryoku <releases@ryoku.dev>
#
# ryoku-desktop-niri: the niri compositor variant of the Ryoku desktop.
# Carries niri, the xwayland-satellite X11 bridge, the GNOME portal backend niri's
# caps report, the niri config tree, and the ryoku-wm-niri provider binary
# (ryoku/wm/niri). It provides the ryoku-desktop-compositor virtual, so an
# installed ryoku-desktop is satisfied by it, and may be installed beside
# ryoku-desktop-hyprland: a switch is then a config change, not a package swap.
#
# There is no plugin subsystem here: niri has no plugins, and its caps say so.
#
# RPM metadata and dependencies live in ryoku-desktop-niri.spec. This sourced
# recipe only stages the payload assembled by stage-package.sh.
#
# niri has no built-in Xwayland; Fedora 44's xwayland-satellite 0.8.2 regresses
# override-redirect popups (upstream #468, fixed in add2795, no release yet).
# The distro package is the display bridge; the popup fix is not delivered and
# must not be claimed as ported. Screen sharing rides xdg-desktop-portal-gnome.
# Night light rides gammastep. Both variants may be installed, so a switch is a
# config change, not a package swap.

  # niri config tree: config.kdl plus every static file it includes (session
  # startup, lid events, machine seeds, and the user override). A missing include
  # is a hard niri config error, so the whole tree ships as one unit. The
  # generated settings.kdl/rebinds.kdl are written by `ryoku-wm-niri apply`, not
  # packaged (see caps.GeneratedFiles). No scripts/ or share picker: niri's leaf
  # keybinds are compositor actions or `spawn ryoku-shell`, and the share picker
  # is a hyprland-only portal helper.

  # xdg-desktop-portal: niri has no backend of its own, so screen sharing rides
  # the GNOME backend (caps.PortalBackend) but the GNOME FileChooser hangs off a
  # GNOME session. This routing pins FileChooser to gtk so file pickers open;
  # doctor's portal reconciler reads it by the running desktop's name.
